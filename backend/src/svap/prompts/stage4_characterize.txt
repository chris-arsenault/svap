Extract the following structural properties of this policy. Be specific and concrete — describe how the machinery actually works, not how it's supposed to work in theory.

1. PAYMENT_MODEL: How does money flow? Who pays whom, when, on what basis? Is payment prospective (before service) or retrospective (after service)? What data triggers the payment? What determines the payment amount?

2. VERIFICATION_STRUCTURE: Who generates the data that determines payment? Is there independent verification before payment? After payment? By whom? How frequently? What is the lag between payment and verification?

3. ELIGIBILITY_CONTROLS: What are the barriers to becoming a participating provider, supplier, or plan? What credentialing, licensing, or enrollment requirements exist? How long does enrollment take? What are the barriers to beneficiary enrollment or eligibility?

4. CLINICAL_CRITERIA: What clinical judgments determine eligibility or payment? Are they based on objective measures (lab values, imaging) or subjective assessment (clinical opinion, patient self-report)? Who makes the determination?

5. SERVICE_DELIVERY_VISIBILITY: Where are services delivered? What institutional witnesses or verification mechanisms exist? Can service delivery be independently confirmed? Are there electronic verification systems (EVV, EHR timestamps, etc.)?

6. CHANGE_VELOCITY: Is this a new or recently expanded program? How has enrollment or spending changed in the last 3-5 years? Has oversight infrastructure scaled proportionally? Were there recent waivers or flexibilities?

7. INTERMEDIARY_STRUCTURE: How many entities sit between the government payment and the actual service delivery? What financial flows pass through intermediaries? What is visible to the payer vs. opaque?
