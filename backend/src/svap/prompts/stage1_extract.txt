You are analyzing enforcement documents to extract structured information about fraud or exploitation schemes.

For the following enforcement document, extract every distinct scheme described. For each scheme, provide:

1. case_name: A short descriptive name for the scheme (e.g., "Operation Gold Rush DME Fraud")
2. scheme_mechanics: What did the actors actually DO? Describe the operational steps — how the scheme worked mechanically, not just the legal charges. Include the sequence of actions from setup to payment extraction.
3. exploited_policy: What specific policy, rule, payment model, or program design feature did this scheme exploit? Be precise — not "Medicare" but rather "Medicare Part B fee-for-service reimbursement for durable medical equipment with no prior authorization requirement" or "Medicare Advantage HCC risk adjustment model where plans self-report diagnosis codes."
4. enabling_condition: What structural property of the policy made this possible? This is the MOST IMPORTANT field. I'm not looking for "weak oversight" or "insufficient monitoring." I'm looking for the specific structural design feature, such as:
   - "Payment is issued before independent verification of service delivery"
   - "The entity receiving payment is the same entity that generates the data determining payment amount"
   - "No cap or prior authorization exists for this billing category"
   - "Clinical eligibility criteria depend on subjective professional judgment rather than objective measures"
   - "The payment rate is the same regardless of actual service intensity delivered"
5. scale_dollars: Total dollar amount (intended losses, actual losses, or settlement amount). MUST be a plain number in dollars with no text, units, or parentheticals. Examples: 10600000000 for $10.6 billion, 556000000 for $556 million, 16000000 for $16 million.
6. scale_defendants: Number of defendants charged
7. scale_duration: How long the scheme operated
8. detection_method: How was the scheme discovered? (data analytics, whistleblower, routine audit, patient complaint, law enforcement referral, etc.)

If the document describes multiple distinct schemes, return an array of objects.

Return ONLY valid JSON. Format:
