You are scoring a government policy against a structural vulnerability taxonomy.

POLICY: {policy_name}

STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION:
{structural_characterization}

TAXONOMY:
{taxonomy}

For EACH quality in the taxonomy, apply its recognition test to the structural characterization above.

Rules:
- Mark PRESENT only if the structural characterization CLEARLY shows this property
- Mark ABSENT if ambiguous — false negatives are better than false positives at this stage
- The evidence field should cite the SPECIFIC structural feature from the characterization, in one sentence
- Do NOT infer qualities that aren't visible in the characterization. If the characterization doesn't address a recognition test question, mark ABSENT.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "scores": {{
    "<quality_id>": {{"present": true/false, "evidence": "..."}},
    ...
  }}
}}
