You are refining a draft vulnerability quality from a structural taxonomy.

DRAFT QUALITY:
Name: {quality_name}
Definition: {quality_definition}

EXAMPLE ENABLING CONDITIONS that belong to this cluster:
{example_conditions}

OTHER QUALITIES IN THE TAXONOMY (for independence checking):
{other_quality_names}

Refine this quality by providing:

1. name: Keep or improve the name. It should be 3-6 words, memorable, and domain-agnostic.

2. definition: A single precise sentence defining the structural property. It must be specific enough that two independent analysts would AGREE on whether a given policy has this quality. Avoid vague language like "weak," "insufficient," or "inadequate."

3. recognition_test: A set of 3-5 concrete YES/NO questions an analyst can ask about ANY policy to determine if this quality is present. These questions should be answerable from the policy's design documents without needing operational data.

   Good: "Is payment issued to the provider before an independent party confirms the service was delivered?"
   Bad: "Is oversight sufficient?" (subjective, not answerable from design docs)

4. exploitation_logic: The causal mechanism. WHY does this structural property create exploitable conditions? What specific action does it enable a bad actor to take? This should be a 2-3 sentence explanation of the cause-and-effect chain from the structural property to the exploitative behavior it enables.

5. canonical_examples: 2-3 brief examples from the cases, showing how this quality manifested in specific real policies.

6. independence_check: Could this quality exist WITHOUT each of the other qualities in the taxonomy? If it ALWAYS co-occurs with another quality, explain why they should or should not be merged.
