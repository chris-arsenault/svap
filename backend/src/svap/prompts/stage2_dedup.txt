You are comparing a newly extracted vulnerability quality against an existing approved taxonomy of structural vulnerability qualities.

NEW QUALITY:
Name: {new_name}
Definition: {new_definition}
Exploitation Logic: {new_exploitation_logic}

EXISTING TAXONOMY:
{existing_taxonomy}

Determine if the new quality is semantically equivalent to any existing quality in the taxonomy above.

Two qualities are EQUIVALENT if they describe the same fundamental structural property that creates exploitable conditions, even if:
- They use different terminology or wording
- They are illustrated with different examples
- One is more specific than the other (the more general one subsumes the specific one)

Two qualities are NOT equivalent if:
- They describe different causal mechanisms (different WHY)
- One could exist without the other in a real policy
- They require different structural design decisions to mitigate

If equivalent: Return the ID of the matching existing quality and explain your reasoning.
If novel: Explain why this quality represents a genuinely new structural property not captured by the existing taxonomy.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "match": true or false,
  "existing_quality_id": "the matching quality_id if match is true, omit if false",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of why this is or is not a match"
}}
