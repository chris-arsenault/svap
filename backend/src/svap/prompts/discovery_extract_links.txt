- title: A descriptive title (from link text or surrounding context)
- published_date: Publication date if visible near the link (ISO format YYYY-MM-DD, or null)

Return ONLY valid JSON:
[
  {{"url": "...", "title": "...", "published_date": "..."}}
]

If no qualifying links are found, return an empty array: []
