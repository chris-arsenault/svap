You are building an EXPLOITATION TREE for a policy based on its structural vulnerability profile.

POLICY: {policy_name}
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION: {policy_description}

CONVERGENCE SCORE: {convergence_score}

VULNERABILITY QUALITIES PRESENT IN THIS POLICY:
{quality_profile}

TASK: Build a single exploitation tree that shows ALL plausible exploitation paths for this policy. The tree has shared early steps that branch into divergent exploitation paths.

RULES — follow these strictly:
- Every step must cite which quality_id(s) enable it. If you cannot cite the enabling quality, REMOVE the step.
- Shared setup steps (e.g., enrollment, entity creation) appear ONCE as common ancestors. Do NOT duplicate shared steps across paths.
- Branch points explicitly mark where exploitation paths diverge (is_branch_point = true).
- Steps describe OPERATIONAL MECHANICS: what would the actor physically do, step by step?
- Leaf steps describe the final exploitation outcome or exit point.
- Include 2-4 distinct exploitation paths branching from shared roots.
- 6-15 total steps is typical. More qualities = deeper trees.
- Each branch should target a DIFFERENT actor type, primary mechanism, or lifecycle stage.

ACTOR TYPES (use for the overall tree and differentiate branches):
- Individual opportunist: low sophistication, many actors, simple exploitation
- Organized network: high sophistication, coordinated multi-party schemes
- Institutional actor: existing legitimate participants gaming rules from within

TREE STRUCTURE:
- step_order numbers each step sequentially (1, 2, 3...).
- parent_step_order links each step to its parent (null for root steps).
- is_branch_point = true marks steps where the tree forks into alternative paths.
- branch_label names the divergent path (e.g., "Path A: Billing manipulation").
