You are predicting exploitation patterns for a policy based on its structural vulnerability profile.

POLICY: {policy_name}
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION: {policy_description}

CONVERGENCE SCORE: {convergence_score}

VULNERABILITY QUALITIES PRESENT IN THIS POLICY:
{quality_profile}

TASK: Predict the exploitation schemes that are STRUCTURALLY ENTAILED by this specific combination of vulnerability qualities. Generate 1-3 distinct exploitation patterns.

RULES — follow these strictly:
- Every predicted step must be CAUSED by a specific vulnerability quality or combination of qualities. Cite which quality_id enables each step. If you cannot cite the enabling quality, REMOVE the step.
- Describe OPERATIONAL MECHANICS: what would the actor physically do, step by step? Not just "they would commit fraud" but the specific sequence of actions.
- Consider how the qualities INTERACT. Combinations of qualities may enable exploitation that no single quality would. The most dangerous predictions exploit interactions.
- For each prediction, specify the ACTOR PROFILE: who is most likely to discover and exploit this? Individual opportunists (low sophistication, many actors), organized networks (high sophistication, coordinated), or institutional actors (existing participants gaming rules)?
- Specify LIFECYCLE STAGE: Is this policy at a point where Stage 1 fraud (simple false claims from new entrants) or Stage 2-3 fraud (sophisticated structural gaming by established participants) is more likely?
- Rate DETECTION DIFFICULTY as Easy (visible in claims data), Medium (requires cross-referencing multiple data sources), or Hard (requires clinical review or economic analysis beyond claims).
