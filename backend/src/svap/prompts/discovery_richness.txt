You are evaluating an enforcement document for structural richness — how useful it is for extracting detailed fraud case data for a vulnerability analysis pipeline.

Document title: {title}
Source URL: {url}

DOCUMENT TEXT (first portion):
{text_sample}

Score this document on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale for STRUCTURAL RICHNESS. A document is rich if it describes:

1. SCHEME MECHANICS — what the actors operationally did, step by step (not just legal charges)
2. EXPLOITED POLICY — the specific program, payment model, or regulatory rule that was targeted
3. ENABLING CONDITION — the structural design property of the policy that made the fraud possible
4. SCALE — dollar amounts, participant counts, duration, or geographic scope

A document is THIN (low score) if it:
- Only contains sentencing announcements without scheme detail
- Describes fraud generically without operational mechanics
- Presents legal conclusions without explaining how the scheme worked
- Is a statistical summary without individual case descriptions

Scoring guide:
- 0.8-1.0: Detailed scheme descriptions with all four elements present
- 0.6-0.8: Good operational detail but missing one element
- 0.4-0.6: Some useful detail but mostly surface-level or legal-focused
- 0.2-0.4: Minimal operational detail, mostly sentencing or procedural
- 0.0-0.2: No extractable case information

Also estimate how many distinct, extractable fraud cases this document contains. A single press release usually describes 1 case. National takedown summaries may contain 20+.
