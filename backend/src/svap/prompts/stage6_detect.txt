You are designing detection patterns for a predicted exploitation scheme. Your patterns must be specific enough that a data analyst could implement them as queries or monitoring rules.

POLICY: {policy_name}

PREDICTED EXPLOITATION:
{prediction_mechanics}

ENABLING QUALITIES: {enabling_qualities}
ACTOR PROFILE: {actor_profile}
DETECTION DIFFICULTY: {detection_difficulty}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES:
{data_sources}

For each step of the predicted exploitation, design a detection pattern. Generate 3-6 patterns, prioritized from most to least actionable.

For EACH pattern, provide:

1. data_source: Which specific data system or table contains the evidence? Reference the available data sources above.

2. anomaly_signal: What SPECIFIC measurable condition would indicate this exploitation is occurring? Express as a queryable condition, not a vague description.
   
   GOOD: "Providers billing >16 hours/day of HCBS personal care services, where the 95th percentile for legitimate providers is 10 hours/day"
   GOOD: "Newly enrolled providers (within 90 days) generating >$200K in claims in their first quarter, where the median for new providers is $15K"
   BAD: "Unusual billing patterns" (too vague to implement)
   BAD: "High claims volume" (no threshold, no comparison)

3. baseline: What does the NORMAL distribution look like for this metric? How would you establish the baseline from historical data? What statistical measure would you use (mean, median, percentile, standard deviation)?

4. false_positive_risk: What LEGITIMATE behavior could trigger this signal? How would you distinguish true positives from false positives? What additional data would you check?

5. detection_latency: How soon after exploitation begins would this signal become visible? Days, weeks, months, or only in retrospective annual audits?

6. priority: Rate as critical (immediate action required), high (investigate within 30 days), medium (add to periodic review), or low (background monitoring).

7. implementation_notes: Any technical considerations for implementing this pattern — join conditions, data quality issues, temporal alignment requirements, etc.
