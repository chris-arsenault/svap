You are designing detection patterns for a SINGLE STEP of a predicted exploitation scheme. Focus narrowly on what would detect THIS specific action.

POLICY: {policy_name}

EXPLOITATION STEP:
  Title: {step_title}
  Description: {step_description}
  Actor action: {step_actor_action}
  Enabling qualities: {step_qualities}

OVERALL SCHEME CONTEXT (where this step fits in the exploitation tree):
{tree_summary}

AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES:
{data_sources}

TASK: Design 1-3 detection patterns for THIS SPECIFIC STEP. Each pattern must be concrete enough that a data analyst could implement it as a query or monitoring rule.

RULES — follow these strictly:
- Every pattern must target THIS step's action, not the broader scheme.
- Be SPECIFIC: "Providers billing >16 hours/day of HCBS personal care services, where the 95th percentile for legitimate providers is 10 hours/day" is good. "Monitor for unusual billing patterns" is useless.
- Each pattern targets a different data source or detection angle when possible.

For EACH pattern, provide:
1. data_source: Which specific data system contains the evidence for this step?
2. anomaly_signal: What SPECIFIC measurable condition indicates this step is occurring? Express as a queryable condition with thresholds.
3. baseline: What does the NORMAL distribution look like? How would you establish a baseline?
4. false_positive_risk: What legitimate behavior could trigger this signal? How to distinguish?
5. detection_latency: How soon after this step begins would the signal become visible?
6. priority: critical / high / medium / low
7. implementation_notes: Technical considerations for implementing this pattern.
