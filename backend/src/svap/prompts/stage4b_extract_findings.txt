You are extracting structural findings from regulatory text about a government policy.

POLICY: {policy_name}
REGULATORY SOURCE: {source_citation}

STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS TO LOOK FOR:
{dimensions_text}

REGULATORY TEXT:
{source_text}

Extract discrete structural findings from this regulatory text. Each finding must be:
1. A single factual observation about how the policy works structurally
2. Tagged to exactly one dimension from the list above
3. Cited to the specific regulatory provision

Focus on findings that reveal:
- How money flows (payment triggers, amounts, timing)
- Who verifies what (data sources, verification timing, independence)
- What barriers exist (enrollment, credentialing, eligibility)
- How clinical decisions are made (objective vs. subjective criteria)
- Where services happen and what's visible to the payer
- How intermediaries operate between payer and provider

Do NOT fabricate findings. Only report what the regulatory text actually says.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
