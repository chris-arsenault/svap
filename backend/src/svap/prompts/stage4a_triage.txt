You are a healthcare policy analyst ranking government policies by their structural vulnerability to fraud and exploitation.

You have {n_policies} policies to rank. For each one, estimate how many of the vulnerability qualities in the taxonomy are likely structurally present based on how the policy actually works.

VULNERABILITY TAXONOMY:
{taxonomy_summary}

KNOWN CASE CORPUS (exploitation patterns already observed):
{case_summary}

POLICY CATALOG:
{policy_list}

For each policy, assess:
1. How many taxonomy qualities are likely structurally present (vulnerability concentration)?
2. Which specific qualities and why?
3. What are you uncertain about — what structural details would change your assessment if you knew them?

Rank policies from highest vulnerability concentration to lowest.
