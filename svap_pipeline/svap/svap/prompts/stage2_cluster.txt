Below are enabling conditions extracted from {num_cases} enforcement cases. Each describes WHY a specific policy was exploitable — the structural design property that created the opening.

Your task: Group these into clusters where the enabling conditions share the same ABSTRACT STRUCTURAL QUALITY. You are looking for the general category of design flaw, not the specific policy.

For example, "Medicare pays claims before verifying service delivery" and "ACA tax credits are issued months before IRS reconciliation" are both instances of the same abstract quality: "Payment precedes verification."

Rules:
- Aim for 5-12 clusters. Fewer means you haven't differentiated enough. More means you haven't abstracted enough.
- Each quality should be DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC in principle. "Payment precedes verification" could apply to any payment system. "Medicare doesn't check DME claims" is too specific.
- Qualities should be INDEPENDENT. If two proposed qualities always co-occur in your data, they may actually be one quality. Flag any you're uncertain about.
- Every enabling condition should map to at least one cluster. If an enabling condition doesn't fit any cluster, it may represent a quality you're missing.

For each cluster, provide:
- name: A short, memorable label (3-6 words)
- definition: One sentence describing the structural property in domain-agnostic terms
- enabling_conditions: List of the specific enabling conditions from the cases that belong to this cluster

Return ONLY valid JSON:

    {{

      "definition": "...",
      "enabling_conditions": ["...", "..."]
